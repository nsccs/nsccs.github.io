# Godot Workshop
---

This series of pages is intended to (hopefully) provide some foundation for those looking to use Godot Engine for their 2D or 3D games and applications. It is split up into five parts:

- Fundamentals
- 2D
- 3D
- UI & Applications
- Bonus Content

Visit the sub-pages to start your way through the content. If you're new here and have no experience with Godot, you should probably start at [Fundamentals](fundamentals/index.html)!
